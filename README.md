Panda-CNC
=========

Introduction
------------

**Panda CNC** is a CNC Milling machine designed to make PCBs at home. It has an elegant design that aims for a structural strength along with functionality.

This project is yet in development, and more data will be posted as it evolves.


Cylonic dust separator
----------------------

We designed a dust separator to go along with the machine, for removing shavings as they are generated, allowing for a much cleaner milling, along with a longer lifespan of the machine.

As for now, only the lower part (the cyclonic dust separator) has been designed. Now we are working on solutions for the vacuum replacement.
